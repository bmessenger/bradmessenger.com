	  <p>I've been building custom WordPress sites for over 10 years now.  By "custom" I mean going with a vanilla theme and building from the ground up.  I've come up with a tried and true toolbox when it comes to approaching new builds.  I like to use the <a href="https://underscores.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" >Underscores</a> starter theme, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced Custom Fields Pro</a>.  I've documented my process for other developers to reference on <a href="https://docs.thegrove.co/wordpress/" target="_blank">GitBook</a>.</p>
	  <p>Outside of WordPress I've been enjoying playing around with some alternative build methods for static sites using tools like GULP and SASS.  As of recently I've been exploring React, which is what this site is built with.</p>
	  <p>Over the years I've become very comfortable with all of the common languages required when developing a WordPress site from scratch.  This includes HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP and Javascript.  If you'd like to view my full resume you can find that <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTAh2rl3ZXhBp-AAIq5-M5KoLfWbrMKvickxOekOMHFBj0Q-p_19YPo1Y66j3jmWf93Di_ZBKYiOPh9/pub" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
	  <p>If you're looking for some help and need a reliable developer feel free to reach out.  I'll take on contract work from time to time if I have the bandwidth.</p>
