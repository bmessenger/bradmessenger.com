	  <p>I live just outside of Asheville, NC in the mountains of Western North Carolina.  With an insatiable appetite for the outdoors and a deep appreciation for the beauty of Mother Nature it was an easy decision for our family to make this place our home.  When I'm not cranking out websites you can usually find me out playing in the forest with my wife and son or sipping on a cold ale at the local brewery with friends.</p>
	  <p>My curiosity in how websites work started back in high school after taking a course in HTML.  After graduating from UNCC and working in the cycling industry for a few years I decided to explore that initial curiosity and focus my attention towards web development.  I built my first WordPress website in 2010.</p>
	  <p>Fast forward to today, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working with an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://silkroadtechnology.com/" target="_blank">enterprise software corporation</a>, an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mountainx.com" target="_blank">award winning news publication</a>, one of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://integritive.com" target="_blank">leading web development firms</a> in Western North Carolina and a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thegrove.co" target="_blank">Botique Creative Agency</a> based out of Winston-Salem, NC.  I'm currently a Sr. Web Developer at a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://famhelp.com" target="_blank">Help and Wellness organization</a> offering a number of different programs for young adults.</p>
